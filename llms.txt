# Builder Kit

> Onchain starter kit for Shape with a Next.js frontend and Hardhat contracts.

Shape is an EVM-compatible L2 built on the OP Stack.
Builder Kit is a monorepo template that gives you everything needed to build, deploy, and interact with smart contracts on Shape.

## Getting Started

Scaffold a new project:
- npx create-shape-app my-app
- bunx create-shape-app my-app
- pnpm dlx create-shape-app my-app

## Project Structure

- apps/web: Next.js frontend (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- packages/contract: Hardhat project (Solidity, deploy scripts, tests)

## Tech Stack

Frontend (apps/web):
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- wagmi + viem for onchain interactions
- RainbowKit for wallet connection
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript throughout

Contracts (packages/contract):
- Hardhat for compilation, testing, deployment
- Solidity smart contracts
- Deployment scripts for Shape Sepolia and Shape mainnet

## Key Commands

- bun dev: Run web app locally
- bun build: Build web app for production
- bun test: Run web and contract tests
- bun lint: Lint web app
- bun type-check: Type-check web app
- bun check: Run lint + type-check + tests
- bun contracts:compile: Compile Solidity contracts
- bun contracts:test: Run contract tests
- bun contracts:deploy:shape-sepolia: Deploy to Shape Sepolia testnet
- bun wagmi:generate: Regenerate typed ABI/hooks from deployed contracts

## Extending

To add a new contract:
1. Create a new .sol file in packages/contract/contracts/
2. Run bun contracts:compile
3. Write deploy script in packages/contract/scripts/
4. Deploy with bun contracts:deploy:shape-sepolia
5. Run bun contracts:artifact to generate deployment artifacts
6. Run bun wagmi:generate to create typed React hooks

## Environment Variables

apps/web/.env:
- NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_KEY (required)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID: 11011 (Shape Sepolia) or 360 (Shape mainnet)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID (optional)

packages/contract/.env:
- DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY (required for deployment)
- SHAPE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL (has default)
